# PotionSteal

**PotionSteal** is a powerful, flexible [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/) plugin inspired by LifeSteal, but with a twist: instead of hearts, it uses potion effects and a balance system to define player "power"! Players can craft custom elixirs and revive books, revive banned friends through a unique GUI, and enjoy a fully configurable experience.

---

## Features

- **Balance System:** Every player has a "balance" that can be lost, gained, or set by commands.
- **Deathban:** When a player's balance reaches zero, they are temporarily banned ("deathbanned").
- **Custom Elixir Item:** A unique potion item that can be crafted or given via command to regain balance or remove negative effects. The appearance and type of this Elixir is **hardcoded** for consistency.
- **Revive Book:** Craftable item that allows any player to revive a deathbanned player via an interactive GUIâ€”consumed after use! Only the custom Elixir is accepted in the recipe.
- **Admin Tools:** Powerful commands to manage balances, immunity, revive players, reload config, and give special items.
- **Custom Tablist:** Show player balances in the tablist (fully customizable).
- **Highly Configurable:** Most plugin settings are easily modified in `config.yml`, except for the Elixir appearance and properties, which are hardcoded for consistency.
